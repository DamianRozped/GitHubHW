What is GitRespitory? 
A Git repository is the .git folder inside a project. The repository tracks all changes made to 
files in your projectover time. If you decide to delete the .git folder you delete your projectâ€™s history.

What are two special features of GitRespitory?
Pull Requests-  a way to ask another developer to merge one of your branches into their repository. 
Branch Workflow - When a developer wants to start working on something they create a new branch. 
This ensures that the master branch always contains production-quality code.

Why or how do those features help your collaborative project?
These features help with collaboration because it allows for more effective collaboration. Pull requests allow the developer to merge a 
branch of another developer, allowing both developers to work on their tasks and merge them. Branches allow developers to work on a different
version of the program without completely destroying the previously created code.
